 * This is an access label, not classification: Support Management's AccessMapper matches a user's
 * configured label patterns against an errand's labels, so adding `ACCESS/LEX` is what actually
 * hands the errand over — the unit manager stops seeing it and the LEX roles start. Draken
 * therefore implements no visibility rule of its own; it only writes the label.
 *
 * The `ACCESS` tree currently holds exactly this one label. MAS/MAR reach HSL errands some other
 * way, so an HSL risk value has no label to write and no handover step.
 *
 * Fixed rather than configurable, for the same reason the IAF/VOF label tree is fixed: it is a
 * business rule, and a deployment that could rename it could silently strand an errand where no
 * role can reach it.
