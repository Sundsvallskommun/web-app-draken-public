/**
 * App-level default-deny authentication.
 *
 * Mounted once in app.ts before the routing-controllers routes are registered, so every
 * route is authenticated unless its path is on the PUBLIC_PATHS allow-list. This inverts
 * the previous per-controller `@UseBefore(authMiddleware)` model, where a forgotten
 * decorator silently produced an unauthenticated endpoint.
 *
 * The guard deliberately does no metadata introspection - it runs in the HTTP layer on
 * every request, so there is no detection step that can quietly stop working and leave a
 * route open. A mistake here makes a public route require auth (visible, harmless), never
 * the reverse.
 *
 * Authorization stays where it is: `hasPermissions`/`hasRoles` remain per route, since
 * this guard only answers "is there a logged-in user", not "may they do this".
