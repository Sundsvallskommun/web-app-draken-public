 * no measure can be followed up there. Spring Filter reuses one join per path, so every `measures.*`
 * clause applies to the same measure row.
 *
 * This borrows the errand list because Support Management has no measure query across errands. The
 * better home is a `GET .../measures` there: paged and sorted per measure rather than per errand, a
 * slim payload instead of whole errands, a count for the sidebar, and a filter written on the measure
 * entity rather than resting on how the library joins. It is deliberately not built yet: the measure
 * model is still settling, and an API contract cut now would have to be cut again. Until then this
 * service is the only place that knows about the errand list; the snapshot it returns need not change.
